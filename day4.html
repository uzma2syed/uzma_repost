    <p><b>Early Life</b></p>
    <hr>
    <p>Eich grew up in Pittsburgh; Gaithersburg, Maryland; and Palo Alto,[2] and he attended Ellwood P. Cubberley High
        School, graduating in the class of 1979. He received his bachelor's degree in mathematics and computer science
        at Santa Clara University,[2] and he received his master's degree in 1985 from the University of Illinois at

    <p><b>Career</b></p>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Netscape</b></p>
    <p>Eich started work at Netscape Communications Corporation in April 1995. Eich originally joined intending to put
        Scheme "in the browser",[4] but his Netscape superiors insisted that the language's syntax resemble that of
        Java. As a result, Eich devised a language that had much of the functionality of Scheme,</p>
    <p><b>Mozilla</b> </p>
    <p>In early 1998, Eich co-founded the free and open source software project Mozilla with Jamie Zawinski and others,
        creating the mozilla.org website, which was meant to manage open-source contributions to the Netscape source
        code. He served as Mozilla's chief architect.[8] AOL bought Netscape in 1999.</p>
